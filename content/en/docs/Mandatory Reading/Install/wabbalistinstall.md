## Wabbajack Installation

1. Download the latest [Wabbajack Installer .exe](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases). Do not run anything until instructed to do so.

2. Create a new folder in the root of the drive where you want Wabbajack to be installed. (C:\ will be used as an example, but it can be placed in any drive.) Name this folder “Wabbajack”. **Important!:** Wabbajack must be placed in a separate folder from where the installation will occur.

3. Create a second folder called C:\Aurbaesence. This folder is where everything will be installed. You can also place it where you would like and name it what you would like, but ensure the location you place it in is not under the protection of your Antivirus. **or inside the Wabbajack folder you created in step 2.**

4. Ensure that the newly created directory is **completely empty.**

5. Ensure that Wabbajack.exe is placed in C:\Wabbajack.

## Mod List Installation

1. Open the Wabbajack.exe you placed in C:\Wabbajack, and wait for it to open. Click the left-most button in the main center area labeled **"Browse Mod Lists"**

2. Check the **"Show Unofficial Lists"** checkbox at the top of the window. Then, search "Aurbaesence", or some amount of the modpack name, in the search box. Hover over the filtered **"Aurbaesence"** mod list, and click the Download button. After that has completed, click the Play button that has replaced the Download button.

3. In the following window, set the Installation Location to C:\Aurbaesence (or wherever you created that directory). The download location does not need to be set manually unless you have drive space limitations. Downloading to a separate folder is fine (for example, on a HDD), but as before it is recommended that the actual install be placed on a SSD. **Important!:** Do not install the modlist to your Skyrim SE installation folder OR the folder that Wabbajack.exe is in. Seriously, this is VERY important. If you are at all confused by this, PLEASE reach out on our Discord!

4. Click Run.

### With Nexus Premium

5. Wabbajack will walk you through logging into the Nexus and authorizing an API key so it can download mods if you have not done so previously.

6. Let Wabbajack do its thing. This will take usually 2-3 hours at most if you have good internet, but the time to download can take quite a bit of time if you have slower internet speeds.

### Without Nexus Premium

5. Wabbajack will prompt you to click all the needed buttons to download the modlist. Be prepared for this to take a really long time, possibly more than one day. Put on some music or a TV show and make a day of it.

Once complete, Wabbajack will say “Installation complete! You may exit the program.” If it does not, visit our Discord server for assistance. **Don’t forget to upload your log file!**  

If Wabbajack fails to download a particular mod, it means that the mod has likely been removed from the Nexus for a moderation reason. This also means that an update to the mod list is imminent. Feel free to report the problematic mod on Discord, but **do not ask other people to share older files as this is a violation of the Nexus ToS.**
