This is an extremely subjective set of mods. Everyone has very different opinions on which of these mods are the best, and this mod list contains what I believe to the best of them.

Modifying the NPC Overhauls in this mod list IS possible, but requires an extensive knowledge of xEdit to undo the patchwork that has been done for this mod list. Therefore, I do NOT recommend you do so.
