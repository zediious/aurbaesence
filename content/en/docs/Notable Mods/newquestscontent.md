## [Alternate Perspective](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50307)

Alternate Perspective is a new take on an Alternate Start in Skyrim. Instead of beginning the game on the carriage to execution every time, you will instead spawn inside the Helgen Inn, within a room that you've "rented". Within here, you are able to select a number of different starting locations and scenarios by speaking to "The Messenger". Many of these scenarios are packed with the mod by default, but we are using a number of addons to the mod that create additional scenarios for you to begin the game with. The room also contains a variety of basic starting equipment for you to choose from, or you can kit your character out with any items you wish using the [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563) item in your inventory (sometimes, different scenarios will also grant you additional equipment).

Despite all this choice, you *also* have the option to simply walk out of the room without speaking to the "The Messenger", to enter the Helgen Inn proper. The room behind you will no longer be the same, and you can continue your journey from there. Speak to the Innkeeper and request a long stay, if you want to experience the *true* masterpiece of this mod.

## [Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194)

One of my favorite content mods of all time, Interesting NPCs adds "Over 250+ fully voiced NPCs, 25+ followers, 15+ marriage NPCs, and 50+ quests" to the game. All of these NPCs are placed in the world in the most natural of ways, usually placed within existing locations as if they were always there. All of these NPCs will offer you an extensive dialogue tree, filled with emotion and great writing/voice acting. A great number of these NPCs will offer you quests, many of which branch into large quest lines, or enable you to begin other quests in the mod.

We are also using a number of mods to increase the efficiency of the mod, make some of the quests easier to begin, and bring the NPCs to the same visual level as the rest of Skyrim. These include [Interesting Follower Requirements for Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45646), [Interesting NPCs Visual Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40046) and [Interesting NPCs - Quest Requirement Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77341). Overall, this is an absolute staple in any load order I make, and I can tell you that there are a number of quests from this mod I have yet to touch. One of the greatest mods of all time.

## [Beyond Reach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3008)

Beyond Reach adds a new, expansive region to the game world for players to explore. The mod takes place in the realm of High Rock, a rugged and dangerous land of treacherous mountains, ancient ruins, and hidden dangers. You can expect a wide range of new quests, characters, and factions to encounter as they journey through this new land.

In addition to the new content, Beyond Reach features unique gameplay mechanics that add to the immersion and challenge of exploring this untamed wilderness. Players will need to be prepared to face new enemies and navigate treacherous terrain as they navigate the perilous landscape of High Rock.

Overall, Beyond Reach is a highly ambitious and impressive mod that expands the scope of Skyrim and offers players an entirely new world to explore. With its rich lore, unique gameplay mechanics, and challenging new content, it's a must-play for any Skyrim fan looking for a fresh and exciting experience.

## [Beyond Skyrim - Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917)

Beyond Skyrim - Bruma is just one part of a huge Tamriel re-creation mod, that was released early. This mod allows us to visit the northernmost province of Cyrodill, Bruma. You can reach the area through the Pale Pass, south of Helgen.

This mod introduces a large new worldspace with numerous new quests, NPCS, and locations to visit. Despite this mod not being the entirety of Beyond Skyrim's vision, it offers us an amazing piece of content to experience nonetheless.

## [Darkend](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10423)

"Travel to the new island of Pharos, explore detailed environments, fight new enemies and discover an Ancient set of weapons of incredible power.
No quest, no holding hand, heavily inspired by The Demon's/Dark Souls games."

Darkend provides an entirely new land to explore, filled with mystery and plenty of spookiness! As detailed above, this mod's design is detailed after Souls games in terms of the "quests", areas, enemies/bosses, and loot.

The mod features a rich backstory that is revealed through gameplay, giving players a sense of purpose as they uncover the island's dark past. The island itself is beautifully crafted, with stunning visuals and attention to detail that immerses players in the eerie world.

## [The Wheels of Lull](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/748)

"Return to Sotha Sil and enter the stranger side of TES lore, as you join the ranks of the mysterious Chronographers in this fully voiced DLC-sized mod that adds over a dozen new quests, multiple new armors and weapons, sprawling dungeons, unique boss fights, and much much more!"

The Wheels of Lull offers a new quest that begins automatically, where you will be tasked with delving deep into the earth to help...someone. You will find yourself in the Clockwork City, a mechanical marvel hidden beneath the surface of Skyrim. The city is a labyrinthine network of gears, cogs, and intricate machinery, populated by some *interesting* beings!

As players progress, they will uncover a deep and intricate storyline, delving into the secrets of the Clockwork City and its enigmatic creator. The mod features unique quests, memorable characters, and thought-provoking dialogues, offering a captivating narrative experience that expands upon the more "funky" aspects of Tamriel lore.
