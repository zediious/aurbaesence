title: Cleaning your SSE Install
weight: 2

As with any modlist, it is strongly recommended that you start with a clean, unmodified installation of Skyrim: Special Edition. This is an **extremely** vital part of the installation process. Do not skip this! To get your Skyrim SE to this state, follow these steps:

1. In Steam, uninstall Skyrim: Special Edition (Right-click > Manage > Uninstall).

2. If there are any files leftover in the Skyrim Special Edition game folder (Right-click > Properties… > Local Files > Browse Local Files…), delete them.

3. Install Skyrim: Special Edition.

4. In Steam, set Skyrim: Special Edition to update only when opened. (Right-click > Properties… > Updates > Automatic updates > Only update this game when I launch it)

5. Launch Skyrim SE to create any INI or registry entries the game needs. Immediately exit after the launcher has successfully selected a graphics preset for your hardware. The INIs will be overwritten by the ones included in the Wabbajack installer.

Your Skyrim should be updated to the latest version before installing the list, which the above process will ensure. This list runs on Skyrim 1.5.97, but expects your game to be updated to the latest version.

This will also ensure that your Skyrim game folder has been completely cleaned of any non-vanilla files. **This is very important!**
