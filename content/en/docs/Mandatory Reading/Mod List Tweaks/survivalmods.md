title: Enabling Extra Survival Mods

Always remember that the list was *not* created around these, and they do not create my desired gameplay. They exist as an option so users that want that gameplay can still receive official support. These mods are entirely optional, and are not how I personally prefer to play the list.

**If you make a support thread in Discord/post an issue on our tracker while using these Survival mods, please make note of that in the request :)**

## Enabling Survival Mods

**Perform the following steps to enable the enhanced Survival mods that are offered as an option with this list.**

**1.** Go to the **"SURVIVAL MODS (OPTIONAL)"** separator in the left pane of Mod Organizer, near the top of the list.

**2.** Enable ALL **(no exceptions!)** of the mods located under this separator. All of them will be disabled by default, and appear like the following;

![survivalmods_1](../../../../survivalmods/survivalmods_1.png)

Read the notes by hovering over the Notepad on each mod, to see any extra information.

**3.** In the right pane of Mod Organizer, click the Plugins tab. Scroll all the way to the bottom. Drag the **Campfire.esm** file up one slot, and it will jump to the top of the load order. You can leave it where it lands.

**4.** Make sure the remaining enabled plugins (all of them are below **Occlusion.esp**) follow the order in the following image

When you load a new game, the MCM for SunHelm will be automatically configured, and the mod enabled. However, the MCM for SunHelm will not update until you open the MCM menu at least once. After you have loaded into the game and your notification messages have ceased, open the Mod Configuration Menu, open the SunHelm MCM, and close it. Your enhanced Survival mods are now ready for use!
