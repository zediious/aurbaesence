Only newly added or changed vanilla hotkeys are listed here. Listed alongside each keybind you will see where you can change this keybind. If you do not see a keybind here, then it is as it is in vanilla. Let me know if you find this is not the case!

## Regarding changing your keybinds

If you want to change keybinds in game with your keyboard, you **must** unplug your controllers. Otherwise, you will be unable to do so.

## LamasTinyHUD

LamasTinyHUD is used to set up sequential equipment loadouts that allow you to instantly swap weapons and magic in your left and right hands, shouts and powers, as well as potions with hotkeys. It can take a moment to get used to seamlessly modifying your loadout, but it is very simple in functionality.

If you would like a video explanation, [here is one provided by the mod author](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv6z4Qp17RY). It would be best to read the below before watching the video, to better understand what is going on.

You can change the LamasTinyHUD keybinds from the mod's MCM.

## Wheeler - Wheel Menu

Wheeler is a fantastic mod you can use to manage often accessed items in an incredibly fluid and easy way. The mod has rich functionality, packed into a short set of keybinds.

You can change the keybinds for Wheeler from within the ["dMenu"](#home).

For information on configurating the Wheel Menu, [read the mod page description here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345), or [watch this video by ARJARIM on it's use here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0xYkTblJmE&)

### Adding and Removing items from the Wheel Menu

Before you can add things to the wheel menu, you need to create a slot. While in the inventory, hold the Wheeler keybind *Q*, and press *M*. This will create an empty slot. You can add as many slots as you want, and you can add new pages with the *N* key. You can scroll through your pages while in the wheel menu by pressing *E*.

To insert an item or magic into a slot, hover over the item/spell you wish to add in the inventory/magic menu, open the wheel with the Q hotkey, and left-click on the entry you wish to insert the item into.

To delete an item from a slot, open the wheel with the Q hotkey while in the Inventory, and right-click on the item you wish to delete. Right-clicking on an empty slot deletes the slot. Right-clicking on an empty wheel deletes the wheel (you can't delete the last wheel).

Equip items to your right or left hand from the Wheel Menu with Left Click and Right Click respectively.
