## [Adjustable Attribute Consumption](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78618)

This mod is used to prevent us from consuming Stamina while outside of combat! This allows you to sprint as long as you would like, until you enter a combat state. Horses will still consume stamina always!

## [Lawless - A Bandit Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88080)

"Lawless is intended to be a complete overhaul of bandit enemies in Skyrim and Solstheim. This mod introduces 13 new bandit archetypes inspired by previous TES titles, all with unique strengths and weaknesses, as well as additional tiers for bandit spawns, leading to more diverse and powerful enemies throughout the game. All bandits have received stat and perk adjustments that fit their respective roles as enemies."

Succinctly put above, you will find a large variety in Bandit attack styles, spells, and more. They will also level with you to a larger degree than vanilla bandits.

## [Loki's Wade in Water](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42854)

This mod causes you to walk slower and slower, the deeper you get into water before swimming. This is a fantastic addition in my opinion, making you consider whether it's a good idea to step into water during combat, as well as providing an immersion boost when simply exploring.

## [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681)

"The goal of OWL is to provide an OPEN WORLD and immersive experience, let the player have a sense of progression as well as obtaining believable and balanced loots throughout your adventure and exploration."

To put it simply, OWL will stop Skyrim from distributing very high-level loot to most enemies, even if you are a very high level yourself. This creates a much more believable world, where you will only rarely find very high value weapons. As part of the tweaks this mod list contains, we have added an IMMENSE amount of new weapons and armor to all the leveled lists in the game, so the "weaker" equipment you will find on most enemies will be of a very large variety!
