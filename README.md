"Aurbaesence" started life early 2021 as an installation of The Phoenix Flavor. The mods that The Phoenix Flavor comes with brought the game up to a perfect Vanilla+ setup. I realized that I wanted to make some changes, in the name of breaking that "Vanilla+" moniker, using TPF as a base for my adventure. I love Skyrim, but after you've played 3000+ hours, you begin to yearn for something more.

As time has passed, and more revolutionary combat/animation mods have been released, this mod list now encompasses what I consider to be the perfect, modern Skyrim. Nearly everything in the game has been touched, in an effort to bring the game to a modern standard, and to make it a game I could play endlessly.

I have enjoyed playing and creating this mod list immensely, I hope it brings you the same joy it has brought to me!
