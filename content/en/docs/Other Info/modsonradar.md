These are mods that I want to add to this list, but cannot yet due to an unresolved incompatibility, etc.

## [lilson's NPC Overhauls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/133689153?tab=user+files)

- Most of these look REALLY great and unique. I will likely be using this and possibly removing some of the existing NPC Overhauls to make way for this.

## [Dialogue Movement Enabler](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43708)

- Incompatible with Simply Knock.
