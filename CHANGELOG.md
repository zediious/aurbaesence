Changelogs were not written before compiling to Wabbajack. The modlist had undergone a very large number of changes over the years before this point. There will be a number of changes that are not logged.

## v0.9 - **4/1/2023**

With the new version of Animated Armory, first-person animations for Animated Armory weapons are now available.

I've also ditched the very odd version schema I chose. Can't explain that one. As the list is prepared for an official "unoffical" wabbajack launch, the version will reach 1.0. From then on, versioning will be done on a save-safe basis, and the documentation will be updated to reflect this.

On that note, this update is **NOT SAVE SAFE!** Due to the updating of certain mods, existing saves will have issues. Refrain from updating for now if you do not want to restart your character.
