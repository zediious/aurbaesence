These are mods that I want to add to this list, but cannot yet due to an unresolved incompatibility, etc.

### [S.M.C - Skyrim Motion Control](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97204)

This mod makes an IMMENSE impact on moving around in 3rd person, it's one of my favorite mods to date. Unfortunately, it has inconsistent freezing issues in conjunction with other mods in the list, and this has not been figured out. There is also an issue with the sprint-jump animation stuttering with this mod installed.

I am keeping a close eye on this mod.

### [Lilson's NPC Overhauls](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/lilson/mods?gameId=1704&sortBy=createdAt)

Most of these look REALLY great and unique. I will likely be using this and possibly removing some of the existing NPC Overhauls to make way for this.

### [Dialogue Movement Enabler](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43708)

Incompatible with Simply Knock.
