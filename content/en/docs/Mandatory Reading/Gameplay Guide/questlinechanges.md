title: Major Questline Changes
weight: 2
---
We use [At Your Own Pace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704) to modify the pacing of the Main Quest, College of Winterhold, and The Companions questlines. This mod makes changes to a LOT of familiar aspects of these quests, so you may feel like something is not working correctly at times. We also use a few other mods that modify the other questlines.

Read the mod pages *thoroughly* to know what to expect! At Your Own Pace in particular adds a **LOT** of new possibilities for these questlines. You should not have any problem blind playing, but you can learn of all the new scenarios in advance by reading the mod page.

### Main Quest

The largest change with the Main Quest is through [Alternate Perspective](../../../notable-mods/newquestscontent/#alternate-perspectivehttpswwwnexusmodscomskyrimspecialeditionmods50307). This mod allows you to begin the game without using the Vanilla Start, but provides an *alternate* method of experiencing the attack on Helgen. At any point after leaving the starting room, you can speak to the **Innkeeper** at **Helgen's Inn**, and you will see a special dialogue option that mentions **"Begin Intro"**. Use this if you wish to begin the Main Quest! This is mentioned on the note in the starting room, so be sure to always look around!

Courtesy of [At Your Own Pace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704), the Main Quest has various new stopping points that will certainly throw you off if you are expecting vanilla behavior. For instance, you will always find the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller in Ustengrav, and can return it to the Greybeards. You will need to speak to Farengar on your own to further advance the quest, where he will have Delphine send you a letter in a few days. Various other stopping points are introduced, where the player would need to take action for further quests to begin.

### The College of Winterhold

In combination with [College of Winterhold - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66666), you will not be able to start Saarthal until you have completed the quests for the masters of each school of magic, which are added by the Quest Expansion. Unless you sign on to the Saarthal expedition as a worker (read the mod page!)

### The Companions

The Companions questline now also requires a great deal more Radiant quests to advance, while also allowing you to take multiple quests at a time. There are also quite a few changes to how certain parts of the questline work, allowing more types of characters to reasonably be a companion than before. You can progress without being a Werewolf!

### The Thieves Guild

For the Thieves Guild, we are using [Thieves Guild Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) in order to restrict when the Thieves Guild questline can begin. You will find that Brynjolf will not offer you any jobs unless you are someone who actually commits larceny.

### The Dark Brotherhood

For the Dark Brotherhood, we are utilizing [Innocence Lost - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80974), [Destroy the Dark Brotherhood - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118229), [Save the Dark Brotherhood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33461) and [Your Choices Matter - A Dark Brotherhood Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46871) to create more scenarios for the player to choose in how they begin the questline, and progress through it.

This covers changes to the main questlines, but does not cover everything! [Check out the Improved Vanilla Quests section](../../../notable-mods/improvedquests/) under Notable Mods to learn more!
