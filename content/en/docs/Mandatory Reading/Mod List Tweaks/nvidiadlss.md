title: NVIDIA "DLSS" - Optional Feature
weight: 5
---

Community Shaders offers an optional [NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation Feature](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140199). This can allow you to get quite a boosted framerate when using the Ultra Profile. However, **using it REQUIRES that you have an NVIDIA 40 or 50 series card, otherwise the plugin will automatically unload.** This mod is **disabled** by default. If you wish to use it, you will need to manually enable it in the mod list.

1. In the left pane of Mod Organizer, use the Search bar near the bottom-middle of the scren, and enter "dlss".

2. In the filtered results near the top left, enable the **"NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation"** mod.

3. You will see a few mods with **"NVIDIA DLSS INI"** in their name among the filtered results. Enable the mod that corresponds to your monitors refresh rate (60hz, 144hz). **ENSURE** that you enable one of these, and **DO NOT** enable more than one.

If you do not have an **NVIDIA 40 or 50 series card**, DO NOT use any of the above instructions!
