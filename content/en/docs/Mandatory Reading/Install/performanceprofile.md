With this modlist, you have the option to choose between the default "Refined" profile, or the "Refined - Performance" profile. Below is a list of the differences between these two profiles

### Refined

- ENB (Choice of Serio's ENB or Ominous ENB)
- DynDOLOD - High (Non-3D Tree LOD)

### Refined - Performance

- Community Shaders
- DynDOLOD - Low (Non-3D Tree LOD)

<br>

Note that if you decide to use the "Refined - Performance" profile, the game will take a small amount of time to generate and cache the shaders on the first launch of the game. This will only happen once.

The "Refined - Performance" profile will perform much better than the default profile, at the cost of visuals. You can use either profile, and you can switch between them at any time. To do so, click the "Profile" dropdown menu at the top of the left pane in Mod Organizer 2, and select your desired profile.

Provided as another option is a "DynDOLOD Output - Medium" mod. This preset uses Medium rules instead of Low rules. You can enable this mod in the left pane of Mod Organizer on either profile, after making sure both "DynDOLOD Output - Low" and "DynDOLOD Output - High" are **disabled**.

Keep in mind that any mods you enable or disable in one profile, will *not* change in the other. If you are "modding inclined", you can ignore the profiles entirely and simply enable/disable ENB, Community Shaders, and DynDOLOD presets to your liking.

Before enabling or disabling any DynDOLOD presets, I recommend you create a backup of the load order, so that you can restore it if the DynDOLOD plugins get placed out of order. This usually does not happen if you enable/disable the presets quickly, but I recommend you create the backup to be safe. Below you will find an image of where to find the create/restore backup buttons.
