The mod list offers "[Dear Diary - Dark Mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60837)" as the default UI texture/sound overhaul.

If you prefer a lighter tone, we offer "[Dear Diary - Paper UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23010)" as an option that you can enable instead.

Follow the below steps to disable the default Dark Mode UI and enable the Paper version. All of these mods are grouped right next to each other in the mod list.

1. **Disable** the following mods in the **INTERFACE AND CAMERA** separator of the left pane of Mod Organizer;

    - Dear Diary - Dark Mode
    - Dear Diary - Dark Mode SkyUI Config
    - Dear Diary - Dark Mode Compass Navigation Overhaul
    - Inventory Interface Information Injector - Dark Mode
    - Dear Diary Dark Mode C.O.C.K.S. Mode
    - Custom Skills Framework Unified Menu - Dear Diary Dark
    - The Dragonborn's Bestiary - DDDM Patch
    - QuickLoot IE - Dear Diary Dark Mode Reskin
    - KIT SkyUI Config - Dark Mode

2. **Enable** the following mods in the **INTERFACE AND CAMERA** separator of the left pane of Mod Organizer;

    - Dear Diary - Paper Mode
    - Paper UI Sounds
    - Sovngarde - A Nordic Font
    - Inventory Interface Information Injector - Dear Diary Paper
    - Dear Diary Light Skin for C.O.C.K.S
    - Custom Skills Framework Unified Menu - Dear Diary Paper
    - Dear Diary Paper - Experience Patch
    - The Dragonborn's Bestiary - Default Interface
    - KIT SkyUI Config - Paper Mode

Keep in mind that the main menu will always use the Paper version of the UI via the "Dear Diary Main Menu" mod. Do NOT disable this mod. You do not need to worry about the plugin load order for any of these mods.
