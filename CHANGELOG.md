Changelogs of this fashion were not written before compiling to Wabbajack. The modlist has undergone a very large number of changes over the years before this point. Most times, if I have changed a mod in any way, I created Notes for that mod in Mod Organizer, which you can view by hovering over the notepad icon on the mod in the left pane of MO.

Basic conflict resolution when adding a mod is generally not included here, every addition to the list is vetted thoroughly. Only if existing conflict resolution was flawed and fixed, will it be included here.

If the third number in a version (the 3 in 9.1.3) is changed or added, then that version is **NOT SAFE** to update to on an existing save at all. If the fourth number in a version (the 4 in 9.1.3.4) is changed or added, then that version should be safe to update to on an existing save, but you may encounter some non-breaking issues. This schema will be changed when the mod list reaches version 1.0.



## v0.9.5 - **WIP VERSION**

### This version is a work in progress, and has not been released yet.

This version is ABSOLUTELY NOT save-safe! You cannot use any existing saves with this version :)

We've replaced iEquip with the modern and *extremely responsive* Elden Equip. Never again will you die as you wait for iEquip to catch up. The mod offers a rather intuitive system for setting up your load outs, and doesn't miss a single beat when switching your weapons. The mod also offers a nearly identical system for quick potions, so you will not be missing easy access to healing while in combat.

An interesting addition to the list with this version is **Fast Travel Cost**. It will now require Gold/Septims for you to Fast Travel. The cost is calculated based on distance. This was added to incentivize exploring the world, but still allow you to Fast Travel if you wish, at the expense of your ever-growing coffers!

We've also removed our existing Companions questline tweak mods, and added the Companions module from At Your Own Pace! This introduces a myriad of changes to the Companions questline, allowing many more types of characters to play the questline, among many other great changes!

I would also be re-missed to not mention **Remote Interactions**. This mod opens up a seriously cool dynamic to interacting with NPCs in the world, allowing you to, well, interact remotely! The hotkey to initiate this is **B**. Jayserpa never disappoints!

### Fixes

- Fixed CTD during Housecarl/Prisoner encounters from Immersive Encounters by updating the mod. (https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/74)
- Corrected Better SkyUI Config not being incorporated into Paper UI config (fix https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/71)
- Corrected position of SunHelm widgets when using them via MCM Recorder preset (fix https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/70)
- Implemented fix for read books/notes not sorting correctly and causing issues reading the right item (Fix https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/48)
- Disabled barrel that was blocking the stairs in Half Moon Mill Inn
- Corrected unbalanced damage values and crafting recipes for RFM. All RFM weapon damages and crafting requirements/materials are now in-line with the tier the weapon is placed in.
- Added required items and conditions to many RFM COBJ's that were missing them.
- Corrected unbalanced damage and armor values on a few equipment pieces.
- Corrected wrong recipe conditions, and added missing recipes for Draugr Weaponry Standalone
- Expanding on the above, you can potentially loot Dwarven/Elven/Glass-damage weapons from Draugr. Elven and above-tier Draugr weapons cannot be tempered without the respective crafting perk, to balance being able to find these more powerful weapons in Draugr crypts.
- Balanced damage values and COBJ records for weapons added by Mihail's creature mods that were missed.
- Corrected wrong comparison value for a variety of COBJ conditions
- Disabled duplicate road signs at border gate to Cyrodiil
- Switched TDM Lock-On Key to re-configured to Mouse-Button-5 by default, instead of U.
- Fixed Triple Triad in Skyrim being broken in some cases by making Container, Gift and MessageBox menus paused.

### Tweaks
- Previously, both Battleaxes and Warhammers shared the same animation. This made it almost senseless to use Battleaxes.
  - Switched the animation used by Warhammers to the proper animation from "elden rim moveset collection". This is a slower animation
  - Switched the animation used by Battleaxes to the Nordic Animation Pack battleaxe anim. This is slightly faster.
- Removed some out of place RFM weapons from certain lists.



## v0.9.4.1 - **5/22/2023**

This version introduces SunHelm and Campfire as optional mods, for those that want enhanced Survival gameplay.

It also chiefly fixes a navmesh CTD near Shor's Stone. That's the main reason this release is coming without much more content additions or removals.

Also a good number of other fixes here! Thank you everyone in Discord for reporting bugs :)

If playing on an existing save, in order for MCM changes/fixes to apply, you need to go to the MCM Recorder MCM menu, and re-run the TPF - Zediious Sprinkles preset.

### Removed

- Hvergelmir Brows for High Poly Head
- zxlice's Backstab and Parry

### Tweaks

## v0.9.4 - **5/6/2023**

Uh oh, scary version number change! With this version, I have fixed a number of incorrect quest records and other things, and a good number of those things that will not apply on a new save. As such, I have labeled the version as not save-safe. For the most part, this will just cause broken things to stay broken. As such, I **highly recommend** you play with a new save on this version, but you may find luck with an existing save. Always make a backup of your saves before playing on new versions! Seriously! If you do play on an existing save, make sure that you dismiss all your followers before loading into it after updating!

With this version, we've introduced Dear Diary - Dark Mode as an optional interface replacer. You can disable the Dear Diary - Paper UI mod and it's related mods, and enable the Dark Mode version and it's related mods. Check the wiki/read the Notes for these mods for a guide!

Character Creation has also been fixed up in a few ways. The High Poly Head head parts will now be the default in character creation, and clipping beards have been disabled, so that you can only see the suitable High Poly Head versions. The High Poly Head hair meshes have also been added, they were left out by mistake. I've also added required dependencies for many of the RaceMenu presets in the list that were missed, fixing purple body meshes on these presets.

There are new mods, some from suggestions! The Idle Animations WheelMenu keybind has been set to " ] } ". More mods from suggestions will be added in the next version.

Also included are a very large number of fixes for combat/equipment balance, including changes to damage/crit, armor value, weight, value, keywords, crafting recipes and other miscellaneous things.

A lot of the fixes in this version were from those in the discord server, playing the list/checking my patches and giving feedback. You know who you are, thank you SO much!

### Fixes

- Fixed wolf/fox from T-posing and/or being invincible in certain situations (fix https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/4)
- Fixed many RaceMenu presets from having purple body meshes (fix https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/53)
- Fixed clipping of beards and hairs by using correct meshes (fix https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/52)
- Fixed certain bounty quests from being in-completeable (fix https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/56)
- Removed incorrect/useless command from Autorun configuration

### Tweaks

- Switched from "Attack - MCO" to "Attack - DXP". This means that all combat animations will follow the exact speed that the animator intended. Attack speeds will no longer be affected by perks, weapon speed, or anything else. Work will be done to change perks that increase weapon speed into something that can be useful.
- Placed faster unarmed moveset with more combo potential behind the first tier of the "Momentum" perk from the Hand to Hand tree, and raised unarmed damage from -50% to -20%
- Raised damage of all katana/dai-katana/nodachi by 2
- Lowered damage of all rapiers/pikes/spears/halberds by 3
- High Poly Head face part will now be the default face part on character creation. The vanilla face part and select hairs/beards have been disabled. There are still a few hairs from other mods that clip on certain races. (fix https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/52)
- Modified  One-hand Katana Animations to also work if you have a Spell or torch in your off hand, not just fists or shield.
- Lots of consistency tweaks for added weapons and armor, to make their damage/crit, weight, value, keywords, and crafting recipes balanced and proper.



## v0.9.3.5 - **4/24/2023**

This version simply removes a weapon mod from the list that has been placed under moderation review. This weapon was previously in the Glass Battleaxe leveled lists. This is save safe, the weapon will simply disappear from your saves if it existed.

### Removed

- Cosmo - Spear Fantasy

### Updated

- ZedPatch 1 - 0.9.3.4 > 0.9.3.5
- LeveledListAdditionsWeapons - 0.9.3.1 > 0.9.3.5



## v0.9.3.4 - **4/20/2023**

This version brings a re-balance of the combat and each difficulty. Using Simply Balanced, I've tweaked base damage values for the player and NPCs to be a *bit* more tanky on Adept. Further, difficulty modifiers have been changed. As you reduce your difficulty, enemies will become very easy to kill, and you will take a little less damage. As you raise your difficulty, enemies will exponentially become more "spongy" and you will take a little more damage. The focus with this is allowing the player to make enemies more spongy, if that is the desired gameplay. The Adept difficulty is what can be considered my "signature difficulty" with this list, and is what I would recommend playing with.

I've also fixed an embarrassingly large amount of borked weapon keywords and DAR conditions for said keywords. A variety of weapons that were not using the correct animations will now do so.

MCM settings for Wildcat have been modified, as well as the newly added Simply Balanced

### Fixes

- Unique Katana animations play only with Katana in right hand and fists or shield in left

### Tweaks

Earlier difficulties have been tweaked to decrease damage to the player, and slightly increase damage dealt to enemies. Beyond Adept, Enemies will do more damage to the player, and the player will deal exponentially less damage to enemies, making them what could be considered "damage sponges" as you move closer to Legendary.

  - Decreased the player damage output of destruction spells by 30%
  - Decreased the player damage output of bows/crossbows by 20%
  - Decreased the player damage of unarmed combat by 50%. You can use melee attacks very quickly.
  - Decreased the damage of daggers by 25%. These weapons can attack very quickly.
  - Decreased the damage multiplier for power attacks by 10%
  - Reduces experience gained across the board by 10%



## v0.9.3.3 - **4/16/2023**

### Added

- Adjustable Attribute Consumption SKSE (Horses still consume Stamina out of combat) (implement https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/44)

## v0.9.3.2 - **4/15/2023**

This version has reduced the .wabbajack file size significantly! You will need to download the new version of Base Coat if updating, which is quite large.

### Updated

- Base Coat - 1.0 > 1.1



## v0.9.3.1 - **4/15/2023**

This version should be save-safe. None of the added or removed mods should have a *major* effect on the game. A few changes simply won't apply on existing saves at all, or will require a cell reset. Removed armors will disappear from your save. Make a backup of your saves before playing!

- Made the Valhalla Combat Timed Block window slightly larger.
- Increased Dodge stamina cost from 10 to 20

- Using an added Blank CC Plugins mod, all non-default Creation Club content you have will be overridden with a blank plugin. This list is only built around the default 4 creations. (fix https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/12)
- Patched three floating lanterns in the Tamriel worldspace (fix https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/13)

- Removed custom movement animation-by armor type condition files, in favor of the actual Conditional Armor Type Animations mod. I honestly did not realize this mod existed, as I was using my own setup for some time. This one works a little bit better and also includes the Goetia movement animations. (fix part of https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/10)

## v0.9.1.1 - **4/2/2023**

### Fixes

- Actually fixed installation issues.



## v0.9.1 - **4/2/2023**

### Fixes

- Fixed installation issues regarding Skyrim version. You must now install the list with the latest version of Skyrim installed on Steam.



## v0.9 - **4/2/2023**

With the new version of Animated Armory, first-person animations for Animated Armory weapons are now available.

I've also ditched the very odd version schema I chose. Can't explain that one. As the list is prepared for an official "unofficial" wabbajack launch, the version will reach 1.0. From then on, versioning will be done on a save-safe basis, and the documentation will be updated to reflect this.

On that note, this update is **NOT SAVE SAFE!** Due to the updating of certain mods, existing saves will have issues. Refrain from updating for now if you do not want to restart your character.

### Added

- Skyrim Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers
- Undead Snow Elves- Mihail Monsters and Animals
- Undead Snow Elves - Xtudo optimized textures 2K
- JK's Windhelm Outskirts
- JK's Windhelm Outskirts Patch Collection
- Interesting NPCs (3DNPC) Script Optimisation
- Hungers - Optimized textures 2K by Xtudo

### Updated 

- Lawbringer
- Serenity
- Tactical Valtheim
- Skybound Underhang Camp
- Skybound Underhang Camp Lawbringer Patch (fix https://github.com/zediious/tpfz-sprinkles/issues/6)
- Animated Armory
- DynDOLOD Output
- ZedPatch 1
- ZedPatch 2
- Leveled List Additions (Armors)
- Leveled List Additions (Weapons)
- Nemesis Output

### Fixes

- (hopefully) Corrected wrong Creation Kit setup causing installation errors. This may be an ongoing process.

### Tweaks

- Added all Animated Armory whips to mace leveled lists (some tiers were missing)
