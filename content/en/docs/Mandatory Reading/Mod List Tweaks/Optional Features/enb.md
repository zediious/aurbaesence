This modlist uses Community Shaders by default. This suite of mods provides an extremely modern look to the game, while delivering a smaller performance hit than ENB. Previously, this modlist used ENB as a default, however the switch was made to CS recently.

If you have not used modern Community Shaders, I *implore* you to try it out! Relatively recent updates have brought the visuals to a level comparable to ENB, with many areas exceeding ENB. The performance gains must also be considered. We are playing a game, after all!

If you do decide you wish to switch to ENB, this modlist does provide multiple optional ENB presets. Below are instructions on disabling Community Shaders and using ENB.

### Disabling Community Shaders

*Note: If you are using [Frame Generation Mods](../nvidiadlss), ensure that you are using the correct version after switching to ENB!*

1. Scroll to the very top of the left pane of Mod Organizer, and select all of the mods within the **COMMUNITY SHADERS** separator.

2. Scroll all the way to the bottom of Mod Organizer's left pane. Double click the **Overwrite** "mod" at the absolute bottom.

3. Highlight the **ShaderCache** directory, and delete it. Ensure that it is no longer in the list of files within Overwrite.

With the above steps, Community Shaders is disabled. To enable ENB, follow the below steps.

### Enabling ENB

All of the mods in the **ENB (OPTIONAL)** separator have notes attached to them, which can be viewed by hovering over the notepad icon associated with that mod. These notes further reiterate what is on this page, but also contain more information. **Be sure to read these!**

1. Scroll to very top of the left pane of Mod Organizer, and expand the collapsed-by-default **ENB (OPTIONAL)** separator, underneath Community Shaders.

2. Enable the **ENBSeries Core** mod. This must always be enabled when using ENB.

3. If you are using **ENB Preset - Silent Horizons 2 - Universal Core**, you MUST enable the **KiLoader for Skyrim** mod. If you are not using this preset, DO NOT enable **KiLoader for Skyrim**. The other two presets do not require anything except for **ENBSeries Core** to be enabled.

4. Optionally, click on the **Filter** option for the left pane of Mod Organizer, and search for `[ENBLight]`. Enable all of the mods that start with  `[ENBLight]`. You may need to expand the collapsed "ENB LIGHT (OPTIONAL)" separator.

- This is an optional feature, ENB light can enact a larger performance hit in certain locations, but I do recommend using it if you are going to use ENB.

**Ensure that you only have one preset enabled at a time**

If you have already enabled ENB are switching back to Community Shaders, click on the **Filter** option for the left pane of Mod Organizer, and search for `[ENBLight]`. **Disable all of the mods that start with**  `[ENBLight]`. You may need to expand the collapsed "ENB LIGHT (OPTIONAL)" separator.

- It is very important that these are disabled when Community Shaders are in use. **They are disabled by default**.
