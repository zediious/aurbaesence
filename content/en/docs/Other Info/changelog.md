Changelogs of this fashion were not written before compiling to Wabbajack in early 2023. The modlist has undergone a very large number of changes over the years before the earliest changelog entries.

Most times, if I had or have changed a mod in any way, I created Notes for that mod in Mod Organizer, which you can view by hovering over the notepad icon on the mod in the left pane of MO.

When armors/weapons are added to the list, they are commonly added to leveled lists. Check the [Added Equipment](../addedequipment) page for a full list of equipment and their leveled list placement.

Basic conflict resolution when adding a mod is generally not included here, every addition to the list is vetted thoroughly. Only if existing conflict resolution was flawed and fixed, will it be included here.

To view the full patch notes for a version, click the **Detailed Changelog** option below the version notes.

## v1.1.2 - **5/4/2025**

This version is **SAVE SAFE!** You should have no issues playing this version with saves created post version 1.1.

This version comes with many mod updates, one of which is SkyParkour V2. This version no longer depends on SkyClimb, and allows for **mid-air ledge grabs!** The mod is also much more responsive than before, which is incredible given how well it worked previously.

We are also re-introducing "New Creature Animation - Dwarven Centurion", as the 2.0 update for SCAR resolves freezing issues with the Clockwork Amalgam. **This fix extends to more animation related freezes and crashes that could have potentially been occurring.**

Along with the above, this version introduces a few new mods, including new Alternate Start choices, as well as a few necessary fixes and tweaks.

## v1.1.1 - **5/2/2025**

This version is **SAVE SAFE!** You should have no issues playing this version with saves created in version 1.1.

This small update introduces Skyrim Motion Control once more! We have added and removed this mod twice previously due to very reproducible freezing while running, in combination with other mods in the list. Having tested with this mod for close to a month over many hours of gameplay, **I have found that these freezes no longer occur**. This mod makes you think about movement much more, and makes your character's movement speed much more grounded and natural. Many of the settings from this mod will be tweaked over time.

We've also disabled Quick Loading with hotkey. Loading saves in game is **highly discouraged**, and this will prevent doing so on accident.

This follows with a few fixes that need to be addressed quickly.

**<summary>Detailed Changelog</summary>**

- Dylbills Papyrus Functions - 8.8 > 9.2
- Overwrite Misc - 1.1 > 1.1.1
- MCM Recorder - Controller Keybinds - 1.1 > 1.1.1

### Fixes

</details>

## v1.1 - **4/5/2025**

This version is **SAVE UN-SAFE!** You should not use existing saves with this version, or you risk causing issues with them.

The modlist's name has been changed to **Aurbaesence! (OR-bes-ence)** As the list evolves, it feels appropriate to give it it's own identity away from Phoenix's great work. Overall, this version represents a point in time, where I now feel this list has nearly, if not fully, reached it's original idea.

The largest change with this version, outside of the name, is the change from ENB to Community Shaders in the main profile. All existing ENB presets still remain as optional mods, however Community Shaders has reached a point where I am entirely satisfied with with it's visuals, along with it's lesser performance hit.

Full Controller Support has also been added, in the form of Complete Controller Setup! This optional suite of mods will allow you to use all important gameplay functions with the controller! [Read the guide here to set up full controller support!](../../mandatory-reading/mod-list-tweaks/controller/)

Community Shaders and ENB Frame Generation addons have also been included as disabled-by-default mods. These will ONLY WORK if your graphics card support DirectX 12/DX12, however you should absolutely enable one of these mods if you meet the requirements! [A guide to do so exists in the Mod List Tweaks section here!](../../mandatory-reading/mod-list-tweaks/nvidiadlss/)

The new game experience has been improved, with many more avenues for equipping yourself in the starting room made available, as well as the ability to instantly learn spells in the starting room! Dealing with Backstories has also been integrated with a new game experience, such that you will automatically enter backstory creation after leaving the starting room, if you choose to do so.

A large number of smaller tweaks, fixes, and additions regarding cohesiveness have been made. Be sure to read the Detailed Changelog!

## v1.0 - **11/29/2024**

This version is **SAVE UN-SAFE!** You should not use existing saves with this version, or you risk causing issues with them. It is highly likely older saves will not load at all.

This release is being made slightly earlier than expected due to Creation Kit updates. There is more planned for the "final" 1.0 release which will come in future updates.

A large change with this version is the **change from Attack/MCO to BFCO**, which are combat animation frameworks used to add motion data to our attack animations. BFCO offers jumping attacks, swimming attacks, and much improved chain-ability of attacks over MCO. All of our currently used animations were converted for BFCO, and are working. You are now able to use a "Combo Power Attack" with the Middle-Mouse click, which can be chained with normal and power attacks. These animations will improve over time as the combo power attack, jumping attack, and other chained animations are given unique animations with either separate animations, or animation packs designed around BFCO with all features used. As it stands, this is a massive improvement over MCO.

A large addition with this version, is the **introduction of enchanted variants of modded equipment**. You will now find enchanted variants of modded equipment in the enchanted gear leveled lists, such as in end-of-dungeon loot chests, rarely in merchant inventories, or rewards from a Jarl. *Not all* equipment has the capability of being enchanted, with some being intentionally left out to make sure there aren't too many enchanted items around. However, any new equipment added to the list going forward will have enchanted variants provided it suits the equipment. No longer will you only find Vanilla enchanted equipment!

When using the Semicolon key, you can now open **The Dragonborn's Bestiary**, a wonderful new addition. Non-human creatures you kill will add a new entry to this Bestiary, showing a description, as well as their weaknesses and resistances. Through the use of community addons and custom made entries, it is planned to have every creature in the list available in the Bestiary! A large amount of custom work has already been done!

We've also added **"Takes Notes!"** which can be opened with the Apostrophe key. This allows you to take arbitrary notes in game. You can write your character's journal, or keep a simple to-do list.

The new **"Dragon Combat Animations" and "DNFA Wolves Combat Behavior"** mods add telegraphed attacks with motion data to both of these creatures, making combat with them much more exciting!

**Immersive Horses has also made it's way in**, with our previous lite horse mods no longer in use. This mod provides a much better experience when it comes to summoning your horse, and other related actions.

**Dear Diary - Dark Mode has replaced the Paper UI as the default for the mod list**. Now, the Paper UI is disabled by default, but can be used as an option.

**Lorkhan - Soundtrack Replacer has also been added as the modlist's new main music mod**. Yggdrasil still exists as an optional replacer, with the patches to Yggdrasil having been moved to their own plugin.

We have also introduced a new default ENB, **Silent Horizons 2 - Universal Core!** Serio's and Ominous ENB presets are still available as optional presets!

A wide variety of new mods have been added, such as EVG Clamber, First Person Interactions, Animated Eating Redux, Grab and Throw, Clockwork, Candlehearth, Gourmet, some new equipment mods, and Arcanum, more spells! A very large number of bugs have been fixed, and tweaks made as well. Make sure to read the Detailed Changelog as even the above does not cover nearly everything!

## v0.9.6.2 - **3/26/2024**

This version is save safe! It removes Skyrim Motion Control, as it has been found to be still causing freezing either alone or in conjunction with other mods in the list.

<details>

**<summary>Detailed Changelog</summary>**

<br>

### Removed

- SKYRIM MOTION CONTROL
- SKYRIM MOTION CONTROL - MCM

</details>

## v0.9.6.1 - **3/20/2024**

This version is save safe! It simply corrects changed links for Attack - MCO and Dodge - MCO as the site they were hosted on was changed.

<details>

**<summary>Detailed Changelog</summary>**

<br>

### Updated

- Dodge - Modern Dodging - 2.1.19 > 2.1.21

</details>

## v0.9.6 - **3/18/2024**

This version is SAVE UN-SAFE! You should not use existing saves with this version, or you risk causing issues with them.

A large change coming with this update is the introduction of the "Experience" mod. Leveling your skills will no longer increase your level alone. For your player level to increase, you must explore/find locations, defeat enemies, finish quests, as well as a variety of other game actions. Your skill levels will be capped depending on how high your character level is.

This version also introduces an "Ultra" DynDOLOD preset, that uses Grass LOD and 3D Tree LOD! This is an extremely intensive preset, and should only be used with very powerful systems. With this, there are now three different presets with this list. The optional Medium DynDOLOD preset has also been removed.

We're also introducing new player homes! For now, we've only added five homes. Any homes added to the list will always be modified to either add cost to them, or increase it if it's too low. More of these will be added with time.

A notable addition is Skyrim Motion Control. It now takes time for the character to speed up and slow down, which creates a very realistic feeling of motion. You can also move slightly faster when moving downhill, and will be slowed uphill.

Another important change with this update is the re-introduction of Weapon Speed effects. These effects will now affect your attack speed, whereas previously they did not. This is going to be fine-tuned over time for balance to prevent too much attack speed.

Mod Organizer has also been updated to the latest version, along with RootBuilder. If you installed any additional plugins, they will need to be updated to this new version!

<details>

**<summary>Detailed Changelog</summary>**

<br>

### Updated

- Blank CC Plugins - 0.9.3 > 0.9.5.4

### Fixes

- This version overrides the new `_ResourcePack.esl` plugin with a blank plugin, fixing freezes that were consistently occurring in certain parts of the map.

</details>

## v0.9.5.3 - **12/10/2023**

This version makes the list installable again, after the recent Skyrim update(s). The changes made to do so will also allow the list to be more resistant to updates in the future.

There are no other changes made with this version!

## v0.9.5.2 - **11/9/2023**

This version was released early due to changes to Skyrim-Guild mods. Two have had their links changed, and one (Creatures Preview) was removed. This will unfortunately remove the Dragon, Bear, and Sabre-cat animations in the list. If it is re-added, the next version will contain it again.

This version is save safe, though you may observe some changes not apply on an existing save.

## v0.9.5.1 - **10/16/2023**

This version very simply includes Campfire, Campfire - Survival Mode Patch, and Custom Skills Framework Unified Menu - Dear Diary Dark, which were left out of the list compilation on accident, as these are disabled-by-default mods. Confirmed that these were the only ones missing. Absolutely a save-safe update!

## v0.9.5 - **10/14/2023**

This version is ABSOLUTELY NOT save-safe! You cannot use any existing saves with this version.

This version introduces a Performance Profile! This is in a simple state as of now, introducing reduced DynDOLOD Output and the use of Community Shaders instead of ENB! Along with this change, 3D Tree LOD has been enabled in the default profile, which will retain it's ENB usage along with a new optional preset! Further performance enhancements will be added to the Performance Profile as time goes on, some of which will be introduced to the entire list. You can switch between the Default "Refined" and the new "Refined - Performance" profiles with the drop down menu above the left pane of Mod Organizer. Keep in mind that any changes you make to mods in the list will not be reflected across profiles, this includes the optional "Enhanced Survival Mode" mods.

Along with the above change, "Safe-Specific Saves" have been disabled for each profile. Your saves will now be read from "My Games/Skyrim Special Edition" in your Documents directory. You should not be expecting to retain old saves with this version, but make CERTAIN you have backed up any saves you care about before updating nonetheless.

We've replaced iEquip with the modern and *extremely responsive* LamasTinyHUD. Never again will you die as you wait for iEquip to catch up. The mod offers a rather intuitive system for setting up your load outs, and doesn't miss a single beat when switching your weapons. The mod also offers a nearly identical system for quick potions, so you will not be missing easy access to healing while in combat. We have also added the new Wheeler Wheel Menu! This is set to Q by default, with the vanilla Favorites menu rebound to Y. These two mods together give you very quick and instant access to your entire arsenal!

An interesting addition to the list with this version is **Fast Travel Cost**. It will now require Gold/Septims for you to Fast Travel. The cost is calculated based on distance. This was added to incentivize exploring the world, but still allow you to Fast Travel if you wish, at the expense of your ever-growing coffers!

We've also removed our existing Companions questline tweak mods, and added the Companions module from At Your Own Pace! This introduces a myriad of changes to the Companions questline, allowing many more types of characters to play the questline, among many other great changes!

I would also be re-missed to not mention **Remote Interactions**. This mod opens up a seriously cool dynamic to interacting with NPCs in the world, allowing you to, well, interact remotely! The hotkey to initiate this is **B**. Jayserpa never disappoints!

This update is *quite* large, and the above description does not cover everything. Be sure to read the full changelog below!

## v0.9.4.1 - **5/22/2023**

This version introduces SunHelm and Campfire as optional mods, for those that want enhanced Survival gameplay.

It also chiefly fixes a navmesh CTD near Shor's Stone. That's the main reason this release is coming without much more content additions or removals.

Also a good number of other fixes here! Thank you everyone in Discord for reporting bugs :)

If playing on an existing save, in order for MCM changes/fixes to apply, you need to go to the MCM Recorder MCM menu, and re-run the TPF - Zediious Sprinkles preset.

## v0.9.4 - **5/6/2023**

Uh oh, scary version number change! With this version, I have fixed a number of incorrect quest records and other things, and a good number of those things that will not apply on a new save. As such, I have labeled the version as not save-safe. For the most part, this will just cause broken things to stay broken. As such, I **highly recommend** you play with a new save on this version, but you may find luck with an existing save. Always make a backup of your saves before playing on new versions! Seriously! If you do play on an existing save, make sure that you dismiss all your followers before loading into it after updating!

With this version, we've introduced Dear Diary - Dark Mode as an optional interface replacer. You can disable the Dear Diary - Paper UI mod and it's related mods, and enable the Dark Mode version and it's related mods. Check the wiki/read the Notes for these mods for a guide!

Character Creation has also been fixed up in a few ways. The High Poly Head head parts will now be the default in character creation, and clipping beards have been disabled, so that you can only see the suitable High Poly Head versions. The High Poly Head hair meshes have also been added, they were left out by mistake. I've also added required dependencies for many of the RaceMenu presets in the list that were missed, fixing purple body meshes on these presets.

There are new mods, some from suggestions! The Idle Animations WheelMenu keybind has been set to " ] } ". More mods from suggestions will be added in the next version.

Also included are a very large number of fixes for combat/equipment balance, including changes to damage/crit, armor value, weight, value, keywords, crafting recipes and other miscellaneous things.

A lot of the fixes in this version were from those in the discord server, playing the list/checking my patches and giving feedback. You know who you are, thank you SO much!

Attack speeds will no longer be affected by perks, weapon speed, or anything else. Work will be done to change perks that increase weapon speed into something that can be useful.

- Modified  One-hand Katana Animations to also work if you have a Spell or torch in your off hand, not just fists or shield.
- Lots of consistency tweaks for added weapons and armor, to make their damage/crit, weight, value, keywords, and crafting recipes balanced and proper.

## v0.9.3.5 - **4/24/2023**

This version simply removes a weapon mod from the list that has been placed under moderation review. This weapon was previously in the Glass Battleaxe leveled lists. This is save safe, the weapon will simply disappear from your saves if it existed.

<details>

**<summary>Detailed Changelog</summary>**

<br>

### Removed

- Cosmo - Spear Fantasy

### Updated

- ZedPatch 1 - 0.9.3.4 > 0.9.3.5
- LeveledListAdditionsWeapons - 0.9.3.1 > 0.9.3.5

</details>

## v0.9.3.4 - **4/20/2023**

This version brings a re-balance of the combat and each difficulty. Using Simply Balanced, I've tweaked base damage values for the player and NPCs to be a *bit* more tanky on Adept. Further, difficulty modifiers have been changed. As you reduce your difficulty, enemies will become very easy to kill, and you will take a little less damage. As you raise your difficulty, enemies will exponentially become more "spongy" and you will take a little more damage. The focus with this is allowing the player to make enemies more spongy, if that is the desired gameplay. The Adept difficulty is what can be considered my "signature difficulty" with this list, and is what I would recommend playing with.

I've also fixed an embarrassingly large amount of borked weapon keywords and DAR conditions for said keywords. A variety of weapons that were not using the correct animations will now do so.

MCM settings for Wildcat have been modified, as well as the newly added Simply Balanced

Earlier difficulties have been tweaked to decrease damage to the player, and slightly increase damage dealt to enemies.

- Via Simply Balanced MCM
  - On all difficulties, the player takes 30% more base damage and NPCs take 20% more base damage.
  - Decreased the player damage output of destruction spells by 30%

</details>

## v0.9.3.1 - **4/15/2023**

### Fixes

- Using an added Blank CC Plugins mod, all non-default Creation Club content you have will be overridden with a blank plugin. This list is only built around the default 4 creations. (fix https://github.com/zediious/aurbaesence/issues/12)
- Patched three floating lanterns in the Tamriel worldspace (fix https://github.com/zediious/aurbaesence/issues/13)
- Fixed incorrect Wildcat MCM configuration (fix https://github.com/zediious/aurbaesence/issues/9)
- Fix clipping of Alternate Perspective Hunter addon and Pilgrim Magnus Shrine (fix https://github.com/zediious/aurbaesence/issues/2)
- Fixed incorrect perk formID in Telekinesis Wood Chopping animations. They will now properly play when you have the second level of the "Philosopher" Alteration perk. (fix part of https://github.com/zediious/aurbaesence/issues/10)
- Removed custom movement animation-by armor type condition files, in favor of the actual Conditional Armor Type Animations mod. I honestly did not realize this mod existed, as I was using my own setup for some time. This one works a little bit better and also includes the Goetia movement animations. (fix part of https://github.com/zediious/aurbaesence/issues/10)

### Tweaks

- Disabled four aggressive Thalmor that spawn near Kilkreath Ruins on the road from Immersive Patrols. (implement https://github.com/zediious/aurbaesence/issues/14)
- Disabled base UNDERDOG sprinting animation
- Modified conditions for athletic UNDERDOG sprint animation to not play for actors with heavy armor equipped. This animation will play if your current stamina is above 150, at a 0.7 randomness value.
- Removed Actor Value checks from Goetia Animations conditions, so that they will play whenever armor is not worn, without the player or NPC requiring high Magicka and/or Magic skills.

## v0.9.1.1 - **4/2/2023**

Actually fixed installation issues.

## v0.9.1 - **4/2/2023**

Fixed installation issues regarding Skyrim version. You must now install the list with the latest version of Skyrim installed on Steam.

## v0.9 - **4/2/2023**

With the new version of Animated Armory, first-person animations for Animated Armory weapons are now available.

I've also ditched the very odd version schema I chose. Can't explain that one. As the list is prepared for an official "unofficial" wabbajack launch, the version will reach 1.0. From then on, versioning will be done on a save-safe basis, and the documentation will be updated to reflect this.

On that note, this update is **NOT SAVE SAFE!** Due to the updating of certain mods, existing saves will have issues. Refrain from updating for now if you do not want to restart your character.
