When running this mod list with the default "Refined" profile, my FPS is 60 in 99% of interior spaces, and will dip into ~30-40 in heavy outdoor areas (such as The Rift). When VRAM caps are reached, which occurs often with my hardware, I can experience large stutters momentarily that can bring me down to ~20 FPS.

If you have worse specifications than the below or cannot deal with the performance described above, you can switch to the "Refined - Performance" profile within Mod Organizer 2, to use Community Shaders instead of ENB, and utilize a less intensive DynDOLOD preset. You will encounter a section regarding the Performance Profile as you read through the Mandatory Reading section.

If I play the list with the "Refined - Performance" profile, nearly all performance issues described in this page are gone. What remains is large stutters momentarily that can bring me down to ~30 FPS, due to VRAM limits being reached. These usually only occur after a long play session, and go away for about 30 minutes at a time. This can be alleviated by reverting to vanilla textures.

My system specifications are as follows. Please use them as a guideline to see if you are able to run this modlist based on the information on this page. Anything better than the below specifications will have little to no performance issues with this list.

You should absolutely have Skyrim and this mod list installed onto an SSD, and they should be on the same SSD. Using a HDD **will** induce lower framerates, stutters, and possibly other issues related to stability. If you have no choice, the list will *function* to a degree, but your experience will be heavily degraded.

Skyrim is very heavy on processors, and also happens to not make use of all available processor cores. This means that processors that are designed with a lot of lower power cores may have trouble running the game/this list. Generally, anything above 3GHz should be fine but I canâ€™t guarantee it. With my hardware, I have no CPU bottleneck whatsoever.

I also recommend 6GB of VRAM, however as shown above it is possible to run this list with 4GB of VRAM. When doing so, you may be exposed to occasional VRAM related stuttering and FPS drops during extremely heavy moments, or rarely crashes. In my experience, I am able to play 3+ hour long sessions on this list with no crashes, only very rarely do these crashes occur. You will know it is a GPU related crash if your crash logs reference a `nvwgf2umx.dll` (with NVIDIA Graphics Cards).

While playing the game with 4GB VRAM, we are almost always dipping into our pagefile, running at 3.9/4GB of VRAM usage. As such, you should make sure you have [configured your Page File](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/increase-page-file-size-virtual-memory-windows).

Again, I HIGHLY recommend that you have 6GB of VRAM when running this list. It will make for a better time overall, but you absolutely can use less.
