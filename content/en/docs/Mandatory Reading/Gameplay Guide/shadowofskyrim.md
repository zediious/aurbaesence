title: Alternative Death System

[Shadow of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65136) is a mod we use to add an alternative death system to the game. When you are killed by an enemy, you will "respawn" outside of the location you died at, without actually reloading a previous save. This also causes the one who killed you to become your "Nemesis". Your Nemesis will take some of your items, and you will receive a quest objective to slay your Nemesis and retrieve your lost items. This mechanic adds a continuous gameplay experience to your death, and can generate quite a few very fun and interesting scenarios.

It should be noted that in certain areas of the game, where quests or other things might break if the death system is not as it is in vanilla, you will simply be exited to the main menu instead of re-spawning. This is entirely to prevent issues with certain parts of the game.

That said, this mod is **not enabled** by default, since MCM Recorder is unable to do so. You will need to enable this mod yourself if you wish to use it in your playthrough. Some players do not like this type of mod, you have the option to keep it disabled. If you did not enable Shadow of Skyrim in the Post-Mod List Install wiki section and you want to enable it, follow the below instructions.

### Configuring the MCM to enable Shadow of Skyrim

1. Go to the *Shadow of Skyrim* MCM menu, open the General tab.

2. Check the "Enabled" checkbox and allow the mod to initialize. Make sure you see "Shadow of Skyrim Initialized" at the top left of your screen after it takes you out of the MCM menu.

3. Then, you need to open the MCM menu again and select the following options to set the settings. If you do not configure the following settings, there may be issues during death scenes, or the mod will not work at all.

    - Respawn Tab > Respawn Location > Set to **Last Location** (this is preference)
    - Defeat Tab > Bleedout Style > Set to Animation
    - Developer Tab > Check Enable Developer Mode
    - Developer Tab > Check Compatibility Mode
    - Developer Tab > Check Alternate Start Compatibility
