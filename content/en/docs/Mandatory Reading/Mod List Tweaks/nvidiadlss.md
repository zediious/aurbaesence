This modlist offers an optional Frame Generation features for both Community Shaders and ENB, if you choose to use it. This can allow you to get quite a boosted framerate.

However, **using it REQUIRES that your graphics card supports DirectX 12/DX12, otherwise the plugin will automatically unload.** Thse mods are **disabled** by default. If you wish to use either, you will need to manually enable it in the mod list. DO NOT enable more than one!

1. In the left pane of Mod Organizer, use the Search bar near the bottom-middle of the scren, and enter "frame generation".

2. In the filtered results near the top left, enable either the **"Community Shaders - Frame Generation (Doodlum)"** mod, OR the **"ENB- Frame Generation (Doodlum)"**. DO NOT enable both of them! By default, this mod list uses Community Shaders, so you should use the Community Shaders version unless you have specifically enabled ENB.

3. You MUST also enable the  **"SSEDisplayTweaks INI - Frame Generation"** mod, located directly underneath the two Frame Generation mods. DO NOT skip this!

If you do not have a graphics card that supports **DirectX12 / DX12**, DO NOT use any of the above instructions!
