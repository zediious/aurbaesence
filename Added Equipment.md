All leveled lists are using Open World Loot as a base for additions, and any native patches are used and/or merged with custom additions in OWL.

Many lists and outfits added by content mods have been altered to take OWL leveled list entries rather than vanilla armor/weapon entries.

Specific leveled list placement can be viewed within OWL lists inside LeveledListAdditionArmor.esp and LeveledListAdditionWeapons.esp
