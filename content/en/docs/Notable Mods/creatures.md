## Mihail Monsters and Animals

Mihail has created the most creature mod for Skyrim. We are not using all of his creatures, but a select "few" that I believe are of the highest quality and fit into the world (a bit of stretch with some) as well as possible.

Mihail also hides lots of his mods frequently, for one reason or another. We are using a few of these mods in our list. Due to Nexus' mod archive policies, we will have no problem using these mods anyways.

### Dwarven Automatons

Mihail has created a number of different new Dwarven Automatons, and we are using six of them;

- Colossus
- Magetta
- Driller
- Power Suits
- Threshers
- Defenders

### [Crows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50447)

This mod adds Crows the game, which are hand placed in locations that would benefit from a bit of crow-iness. These crows will make their well know cawing sound, and add to the atmosphere of any location they are placed.

### [Bone Hawk](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55619)

With this mod, Mihail overhauls the Bone Hawk that flies around Castle Volkihar (you very well may have never seen this).

### [Dugongs and Manatees (Hidden)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31228)

This simple mod adds two new sea creatures to Skyrim's waters. These are placed (for the most part) only along the northern coast. A bit of extra life to Skyrim!

### [Soul Trees (Hidden)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30368)

This mod adds static "Soul Trees" to the Soul Cairn worldspace. These eldritch beings fit into the landscape quite well, and have some interesting mechanics.

### [Gargoyles (Hidden)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55620)

This overhaul mod brings back a cut type of Gargoyle, and modifies the existing Gargoyles.

### [Ice Titans](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47181)

A creature mod from Mihail, this mod adds huge giant-like creatures to some of the cold areas of Skyrim. These beasts are even taller than the Giants of Skyrim, and will force you to change your route if you are not prepared for them.

### [Iron Golems (Hidden)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29228)

This mod adds a few very large Iron Golems to the world. Most of these are placed in deep, forgotten dungeons, but you may find them in the employ of certain factions in Skyrim.

### [War Revenants (Hidden)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29583)

War Revenants adds a new location to the Whiterun tundra, which houses the site of a horrible amalgamation of death from the Civil War. Within, you will find creatures that have been formed from the corpses of the war, and embody the spirit of hate that runs amok. This is an interesting location, filled with some interesting creatures.

### [Bone Colossus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24521)

"Bone Colossi are large undead golems formed from thousands of bones gathered together in a vaguely humanoid form and animated using powerful necromancy. They are conjured from piles of osseous matter by Bonemasters and use small Bonelings as their minions."

These powerful creatures can only be found deep within dungeons, usually accompanied by a powerful Necromancer (but not always). These beasts of Necromancy are huge, deal powerful blows, and can overrun you with their Boneling minions. When delving into a dungeon, always be on the lookout!

### [Leshens (Old Gods of the Hunt)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27520)

"The Old Gods of the Hunt are powerful and mysterious ancient creatures...Ferocious and stunning, these Wild Hunt beasts are connected to Hircine, and have been worshiped since the beginning by the Reachmen and the Bosmer as one of their Old Gods."

Inspired by Leshens from The Witcher, these druidic creatures can be found in lost places of nature, and can also rarely found in the company of the Forsworn. They unleash powerful nature magic, and can summon wild animals to assist them. This is not to mention their brute size and strength. The ultimate Spriggan!

### [Crystal Golems](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24591)

"Crystal Golems are large masses of faceless and vaguely humanoid crystal, animated by unknown means, that patrol Blackreach." These large crystalline creatures will charge at any enemies and crush them with their huge arms. They also happen to be composed of an Enchanter's favorite tool.

### [Gravelords](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27365)

"Gravelords are enigmatic entities formed by hundreds of darkened bones covered in a cloak of dense shadows. They're the spawn of Sithis, the representation of the primordial state of emptiness and the Void. They roam the darkest places of Nirn and Oblivion, surrounded by their dread armies of scary Gravelord Servants."

Inspired by Nito of Dark Souls, this creature is a powerful necromantic creature. This creature can only be found in deep forgotten dungeons or in the company of powerful necromancers, similar to the Bone Colossus.
