As with any modlist, it is extremely important that you start with a clean, unmodified installation of Skyrim: Special Edition. This is an **extremely** vital part of the installation process, do NOT skip this!

This list requires that you have the **Creation Store version of Rare Curios**, rather than the Steam-downloaded versions.

This list also requires you to install the Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit from Steam. **The list will fail to install if the Creation Kit is not installed to the Skyrim game folder.**

To perform all of the above, **follow the below steps:**

### Installing Skyrim

1. In Steam, uninstall Skyrim: Special Edition (Right-click > Manage > Uninstall).

2. If there are any files leftover in the Skyrim Special Edition game folder (Right-click > Properties… > Local Files > Browse Local Files…), delete them.

3. Install Skyrim: Special Edition.

4. In Steam, set Skyrim: Special Edition to update only when opened. (Right-click > Properties… > Updates > Automatic updates > Only update this game when I launch it)

Your Skyrim should be updated to the latest version before installing the list, which the above process will ensure. This list runs on Skyrim 1.5.97, but **expects your game installation to be updated to the latest version**. Do NOT use any downgrade patchers.

This will also ensure that your Skyrim game folder has been completely cleaned of any non-vanilla files. **This is very important!**

### Installing Creation Store Rare Curios

1. Return to your Skyrim Special Edition installation directory, and enter the **Data** directory. **Delete the following two files**:

    - `ccbgssse037-Curios.bsa`
    - `ccbgssse037-Curios.esl`

2. Launch **Skyrim Special Edition** from Steam, and click **Play** to load into the main menu in the vanilla game after your graphics preset is automatically selected.

3. Once you load in, select **Creations** in the main menu.

4. Select **Search** at the bottom, and search for **Rare Curios**

5. Select **Download** near the middle-left to download Rare Curios, ensure that you keep the game open until the progress changes to **Installed**!

6. Exit the game. **DO NOT verify the game with steam** at this point until the list is installed!

7. Return to your Skyrim installation directory, and the **Data** directory. Verify that the curios `.esl` and `.bsa` files have been recently modified, and that they start with a **lower case c like so**

    - `ccbgssse037-curios.bsa`
    - `ccbgssse037-curios.esl`

The version of Rare Curios downloaded from the Creations store is slightly different than what is downloaded from Steam, despite the content being the same. The above process will ensure you have the Creation store version of Curios. **The list will fail to install if this is not the case!**

### Installing the Creation Kit

1. Go to the Store tab in the Steam app, search for "Skyrim Special Edition: Creation Kit", and click the result.

    - Make sure you are downloading the **Special Edition** Creation Kit! Here is the direct link: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/)

2. Scroll down, and click the green "Free" button to install the Creation Kit. This will/should be installed to the Skyrim Special Edition game folder.

You now have the **Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit** installed, which is required to install the list.
