title: Immersive Interactions for Quick Loot
weight: 3
---

In this mod list, we use [Immersive Interactions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47670) to add unique animations for a huge variety of interactions within the game. We also use [Quick Loot IE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120075), which allows you to loot containers, bodies, etc without opening the container menu. Due to this, Immersive Interaction's animations will not play when looting via Quick Loot.

To remedy this, we use the mod ["Immersive Interactions for Quick Loot"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96894). This solves the above problem, while allowing you to back out of the animation quickly by moving forward or looting the container completely.

That being said, this behavior might be *very* annoying to certain players. I am well aware that many do not like Immersive Interactions at all. As such, you can safely disable "Immersive Interactions for Quick Loot" within the mod list. To do so, follow the below instructions;

1. Within the Left Pane of Mod Organizer, click the *Filter* text box at the bottom. Enter "Immersive Interactions for Quick Loot" without quotes.

2. Uncheck the mod that appears in the left pane, "Immersive Interactions for Quick Loot"

I recommend that you decide whether you want to use this mod *before* starting a playthrough, but you can safely disable it during a playthrough. You should *NOT* disable the full "Immersive Interactions - Animated Actions" in any event.

You *can* safely modify the Mod Configuration Menu for "Immersive Interactions - Animated Actions", to disable a wide variety of the default animations that play in game.
